What is it?
-----------
Zen Notes - a mobile web application for creating and 
editing textual items in browser. They look awesome on desktop, too!


What tools and technologies have been used for Zen Notes?
---------------------------------------------------------
Zen Notes are created with jQuery Mobile and HTML5 Local Storage. 
Also, I used jQuery for interactivity and the ability to create
and save edited notes, and CSS for styling.  


How to use Zen Notes?
---------------------
From the beginning you'll see an input field, a button to 
save your notes and a welcoming note I created for you.
This gives you a presentation of how your list of notes will look 
like. Hope you'll like it. 


What can be improved?
---------------------
For the app styling I overrode jQuery Mobile theme
instead of using Theme Roller. Having !important
throughout the CSS file is not elegant solution, but 
for this case I decided to hand-code instead of 
using Theme Roller web interface.
