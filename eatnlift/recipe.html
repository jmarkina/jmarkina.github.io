            <p class="media-heading">1 cup jasmine rice (206 Cal);<br>2 (170 g) tilapia fillets (224 Cal);<br>1 cup green Beans (31 Cal);<hr/><b>Directions</b><br>In a medium, heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, combine 1-3/4 cups water, the rice, and a bit of butter or oil and salt, if you like. Bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and cover. (If you have an electric stove, use two burners: bring the rice to a boil on a hot burner and then immediately slide it to a burner set on low to continue cooking at a slow simmer.) Cook at a gentle simmer until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 12 minutes (it's okay to lift the lid to make sure the rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbedâ€”just replace the lid quickly).<br>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, undisturbed with the lid on, for at least 5 minutes and for as long as 30 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the rice gently with a fork or chopstick, and serve.<br><b>Pan-fried tilapia fillets</b><br>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.
            Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the tilapia in the hot oil until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.<br><b>Stir fried green beans</b><br>Start by heating the wok or pan over very high heat for 1-2 minutes, then add oil and heat about 30 seconds more, then stir fry the green beans and garlic for about 2 minutes.</p>
